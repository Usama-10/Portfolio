</span></span><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>iPhone is a chain of smartphones developed
and manufactured by Apple Inc. these smartphones run on the Apple-owned iOS
operating system. The first ever iPhone was launched in 2007 by the CEO of
Apple Steve Jobs. Afterward, Apple releases new iPhone models and iOS updates
each year. More than 2.2B iPhones have been sold till today.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>IPHONE 14 SERIES</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>The latest is the iPhone 14 series launched
on September 16, 2022. This series includes 4 models iPhone 14,iPhone 14 plus,
iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 pro max available in unique and vibrant colors.
Apple did away with the iPhone mini. As usual, the iPhone 14 series comes with
awesome upgrades just like Apple does each year.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>FEATURES</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>The iPhone 14 series has a pack full of
great features, this year Apple introduced a notch which is called the dynamic
island, eSIM, an always-on display, iOS 16 upgrade, A16 bionic chip, emergency
SOS, car crash detection, satellite connectivity, action mode, screen
brightness up to 2000 nits, photonic engine, up to 120Hz refresh rate and of
course finally a 48MP camera setup.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>The most headlined features of the iPhone
14 series are dynamic island notch, emergency SOS, car crash detection, and
satellite connectivity.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>PERFORMANCE</b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>The iPhone 14 series is now equipped with
an A16 Bionic chip (only in 14 pro and 14 pro max) which gives a 10% boost to
performance and it is 20% more efficient than last year’s 15 bionic because of
4nm architecture.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>Now the next comes is the cameras the front-facing
camera doesn’t seem to be different but now it has autofocus. The games are
changed when it comes to rear cameras. For the first time in the iPhone's
history, the main camera is the 48MP sensor giving awesome shots in low light
conditions, a 12MP ultrawide lens for outdoor views with an improved
anti-distortion tech. <span style='color:#111111'>The larger 1.4-micron pixels
depth lens for improved macro photography to take impressively detailed shots.
The last comes the 12MP telephoto lens equipped with 3x zoom ideal for awesome
portrait shots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span style='color:#111111'>When it comes
to videography, there is a huge improvement iPhone can now support a 4k video
recording at 60fps better than the previous model which has 30fps, with HDR and
Dolby vision supported and an action mode that reduced camera shake.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span style='color:#111111'>Android devices
are increasing battery performance, when it comes to apple it doesn’t seem to
be the same. Apple never tells publicly the battery capacity in mAH. The company
claims that the new iPhone 14 can last up to 23 hours while watching videos (1
hr more than the previous model) which is not a huge upgrade along with 25W
fast charging (not included in the box), 15W MagSafe, and 7.5W Qi wireless
charging.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;color:#111111'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><span style='color:#111111'>PROS AND CONS</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span style='color:#111111'>Improved camera
and overall performance 10 times better than the previous version, the dynamic
island seems to be very unique notch replacement, the full screen always on
display, car crash detection, next level display quality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span style='color:#111111'>No sim tray, no
fast charging, not much battery improvement (even worse than last year), very
expensive (especially in the UK), emergency SOS working only in USA and Canada.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span style='color:#111111'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span style='color:#111111'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;color:#111111'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><span style='color:#111111'>WORTH BUYING OR NOT</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span style='color:#111111'>The first
factor is the prices, the normal iPhone 14 starts from $799 for the 128GB
variant and ends at $1499 for the iPhone 14 pro max 1TB variant. Although in the
UK, it is hard to recommend 1099 pounds for the pro version with a massive
increase of 150 pounds from last year's variant. No SIM option in upper models
would bother some audiences. The biggest mistake that attracts most of the
audience is the battery performance. If we think of the android side, Apple is
too far away from this competition.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast><span style='color:#111111'>The feature that
attracts most of the audience is the stunning design and 10x better camera
performance with fully loaded features. Despite these, there are no such upgrades
that would lead you to buy or upgrade to iPhone 14 series.</span></p>
